## Personal projects
I've build [tinydb](https://github.com/mattheusv/tinydb), a simple database based on Postgresql to learn more about database in general. It implements the basics of Postgres wire protocol, a simple query planner and executor and a storage engine that use the [Heap data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) for file format.

## Programming languages
- Confortable: Go, Python, Java
- Familiar: C, C++, Rust

I like to understand problems in depth and creating scalable, secure, well-documented software. I'm always interested in 
learning programming languages, and new tools, I really like to be always in the learning process.
